## Programming languages

There are five major categories of programming languages.

1. Procedural programming languages :- Programming languages that follow a procedural approach, where programs are structured around procedures or steps to be executed in a specific order.
   1. C and C++
   2. Java
2. Functional programming languages :- Rather than focusing on the execution of statements, functional languages focus on the output of mathematical functions and evaluations.
   1. Scala
   2. Erlang
3. Object-oriented programming languages :- oriented programming is about creating objects that contain both data and methods.
   1. Java
   2. C++
4. Scripting languages :- Scripting languages are used to automate repetitive tasks, manage dynamic web content, or support processes in larger applications
   1. PHP
   2. Node.js
5. Logic programming languages :- Instead of telling a computer what to do, a logic programming language expresses a series of facts and rules to instruct the computer on how to make decisions.
   1. Prolog
   2. Absys

We attempt to provide a straightforward examination of the object-oriented programming language by utilizing the java programming language.

## OOP (Java)

OOP stands for object-Oriented Programming.
