## Programming languages

There are five major categories of programming languages.

1. Procedural programming languages :- Programming languages that follow a procedural approach, where programs are structured around procedures or steps to be executed in a specific order.
   1. C and C++
   2. Java
2. Functional programming languages :- Rather than focusing on the execution of statements, functional languages focus on the output of mathematical functions and evaluations.
   1. Scala
   2. Erlang
3. Object-oriented programming languages :- oriented programming is about creating objects that contain both data and methods.
   1. Java
   2. C++
4. Scripting languages :- Scripting languages are used to automate repetitive tasks, manage dynamic web content, or support processes in larger applications
   1. PHP
   2. Node.js
5. Logic programming languages :- Instead of telling a computer what to do, a logic programming language expresses a series of facts and rules to instruct the computer on how to make decisions.
   1. Prolog
   2. Absys

We attempt to provide a straightforward examination of the object-oriented programming language by utilizing the java programming language.

## OOP (Java)

OOP stands for object-Oriented Programming.

## Class

## Object

## Method

## Constructors

A constructor in java is a special method, used to set initial values of object attributes.

_Note_

1. constructor name must match the class name, and it cannot have a return type.
2. Constructor is called when object is create.
3. All classes have constructor by default.

## Encapsulation

Hidding user data from users is encapsulation, to achieve encapsulation you must :-

1. Declare class variables/attributes as private.
2. provide public get and set methods to access and update the value of a private variable.


## Inheritance

inheriting methods and attributes from one class to another is called as inheritance. Inheritance can be grouped in two categories :-

1. subclass (child) :- The class that inherits from another class.
2. superclass (parent) :- The class being inherited from.

In java we use *extends* keyword to inherit


## Plymorphism

Polymorphoism means *many forms*. polymorphoism like inheritance lets us inherit attributes and methods from another class. Basically allows us to perform a single action in different ways.
