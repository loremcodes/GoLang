## Struct instead of classes

Go does not provide classes but it does provide structs.
Method can be added on structs. This provide the behaviour of bundling the data and methods that operate on the data together akin to a class.

## What are classes

Classes can be defined as group of objects with common properties.

## What are structs

Struct or structures are user-defined type that allows to group/combine items of possibly different types into a single type.

## What are methods

A methods sometimes also called as function is a block of code which only runs when it is called.
